# Types, logic and people thingies

- [Type systems and logic](https://codewords.hackerschool.com/issues/one/type-systems-and-logic),
    by Alyssa Carter, part of Hackerschools new quarterly publication [Code Words](https://codewords.hackerschool.com/).

    This is a nice introduction to the correspondence between type systems and
    (constructive) logic. It starts with Haskell's types, which correspond to
    a relatively simple (and a bit strange) logic, but also covers dependent
    types and even goes a bit beyond that.

    Evan argues that to really program well you will need to learn C. The title
    references the fact that when searching for problems you won't go look at
    higher levels at the stack, but that you will have to look at lower level
    code (likely in C) at some point.

    This article isn't specific to start-ups, it applies to anything you're doing
    when you're young.

    Fascinating. And quite strange.
