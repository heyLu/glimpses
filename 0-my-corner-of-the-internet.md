    I'm struggling with this in multiple ways. Both because I'm trying to teach programming and because I'm trying to learn myself.
* [µKanren - A minimal functional core for relational programming ](http://webyrd.net/scheme-2013/papers/HemannMuKanren2013.pdf)

    I've read this a few months ago, but have recently picked it up again, trying to read The Reasoned Schemer, going through some of the materials on [miniKanren.org](http://miniKanren.org) and trying to implement some things myself.

    Try writing a relational Scheme interpreter ([intro to miniKanren](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHov3fKYqBA), [writing the interpreter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFE2E91VDAk)), translate some solutions from Prolog ([core.logic](https://github.com/clojure/core.logic) might help) or try modelling finite state automata.

    Also read [A Shallow Introduction to the K Programming Language](http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2002/11/14/22741/791) (or part of it), if you're not familar with it.
