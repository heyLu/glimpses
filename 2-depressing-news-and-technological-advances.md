# Depressing news & technological advances

* lots and lots of depressing things about tech in particular, but also about
    society in general

    - [You Can’t Go Back & There’s No End in Sight](http://juliepagano.com/blog/2014/10/10/life-and-times-of-a-tech-feminist-killjoy-you-cant-go-back-theres-no-end-in-sight/)
    - the timelines/tweets of [Randi Harper](https://twitter.com/freebsdgirl) and
        lots of other women in tech and/or gaming
    - and finally, the deaths of Mike Brown and Eric Gardner and the decision of
        both juries to not indict the police officers who killed them.

That's probably enough for quite a while. I don't know how to deal with it.

* [Future Programming Workshop](http://www.future-programming.org/program.html)
    - [Toby Schachman “Shadershop”](http://tobyschachman.com/Shadershop/), a direct-manipulation
        interface for GLSL shaders, with excellent introductionary videos.

        2D noise is explained in the third video, I never thought I could get
        an intuition about how it works in about 15 minutes.
    - [Jonathan Edwards “Two-way Dataflow”](http://vimeo.com/106073134)
    - [Yair Chuchem & Eyal Lotem “Lamdu - towards a next generation IDE”](http://vimeo.com/97713439),
        a fascinating demonstration of a structural editing environment.

    and more, the other videos look promising as well.
* it turns out it's possible to read intimidating papers, you just need to print
    them out, turn off your computer and spend a few hours reading them. and
    then maybe try implementing (or copying the code from the paper) to
    really understand them.

    happened to me with the [cKanren - miniKanren with Constraints](http://www.schemeworkshop.org/2011/papers/Alvis2011.pdf)
    paper.
